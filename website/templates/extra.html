	"He is  a very great guy, he wont give up until his job is done, he is on top of everything and will make sure the whole house buying experience is as smooth as possible.."

	Bryan and his team are extremely easy to work with and very accommodating. He is knowledgeable and professional. They were able to effectively market my home and get it sold within the first week of hitting the market.  Bryans preparation and attention to detail really made for a smooth and  painless transaction.  They made valuable recommendations on staging, pricing, and strategies.  We were kept in constant communication throughout the entire process and I didn't even have to lift a finger.  Bryan has my highest regard."

	"Our experience with Bryan has been excellent since day one. We contacted him to view a house and he was available the same day for the viewing. He knew so much about the house and was prepared to answer any questions we had. He is fast, efficient, quick to respond, puts his clients first, and is  very personable. After putting in our offer, he made the home buying process seamless and less daunting, which was important since weâ€™re first time home buyers. He connected us with individuals on his team to keep us all on the same page. We closed escrow in about 20 days. Overall, we are glad to have met Bryan and we are very satisfied with his service."
